# This is The Progress Of My Self Study Programming
I dont have IT background at all, but i learn it that programing is amazing and decide to learn it.
I create this so i can learn how much i ve learn, and to keep me motivated that "You ve learn all of this"
"Keep pushing, you know its hard to do all this code from nothing and you want to give up after all of that progress"
So thats it.
1 October 2020, first day learn programming
