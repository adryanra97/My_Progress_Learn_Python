#Here is the code in one of assignment in mooc, i modified a little so it cant use directly on that website to keep the cheater away :D
#mooc is very good, i learn lot of basic that i didnt understand before
#i used to learn from project guide or course with advance but, now i understand the basic is the most important
#i try code this for 1 hour, but its fun
#my first long code of python
